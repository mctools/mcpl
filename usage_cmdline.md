The MCPL distribution includes a handy command-line tool, `mcpltool`, which can be used to either inspect MCPL files, or to carry out a limited number of operations on them. Since release 1.2, it also includes a second tool, `pymcpltool`, which provides additional inspection features in the form of plots and statistics display.

This page includes a few examples of how the command-line tools can be used, but users are referred to
{% include linkpaper.html subsection=2.3 %} for more information.

## Examples

A few examples of how to use the command-line tools are provided here. Note that a small sample MCPL file is available at [examples/example.mcpl]({{"/raw/path_to_mcpl2/examples/example.mcpl" | prepend: site.github.repository_url }}), in case new users would like something to try the `mcpltool` on.

### Inspect file contents

Simply invoking `mcpltool` or `pymcpltool` on a file with no additional arguments, results in a summary of the header information being printed, in addition to the particle state information of the first ten particles in the file:

```shell
$ mcpltool example.mcpl
```
```
Opened MCPL file example.mcpl:

```

The `-l` (limit) and `-s` (skip) flags can be used to change which particles are printed (use `-l0` to print _all_ particles), and `-j` can be used to suppress the header information.

### Extract some particles from a file

Using the `--extract` flag to `mcpltool`, it is possible to extract a subset of particles from a file, into a new file. Using the `-p` flag, one can select according to [particle type](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/reviews/rpp2014-rev-monte-carlo-numbering.pdf) (2112=neutron, 22=gamma, etc.).

```shell
mcpltool --extract -p2112 example.mcpl justneutrons.mcpl
```
```
MCPL: Attempting to compress file justneutrons.mcpl with gzip
MCPL: Succesfully compressed file into justneutrons.mcpl.gz
MCPL: Succesfully extracted 726 / 1006 particles from examples/example.mcpl into justneutrons.mcpl.gz
```

Note that the output file is currently always compressed into .mcpl.gz when possible (this behaviour might change in the future).

You can also use the `-l` and `-s` flags to extract particles according to their position in the file, which might for instance be useful to extract a specific interesting particle from a huge file. Here we extract 1 particle starting from position 123:

```shell
mcpltool --extract -l1 -s123  examples/example.mcpl selected.mcpl
```
```
MCPL: Attempting to compress file selected.mcpl with gzip
MCPL: Succesfully compressed file into selected.mcpl.gz
MCPL: Succesfully extracted 1 / 1006 particles from examples/example.mcpl into selected.mcpl.gz
```

### Merging compatible files

Using the `--merge` flag to `mcpltool`, it is possible to merge contents from a list of compatible files into a single new one. Here four existing files are merged, creating newfile.mcpl as a result:

```shell
mcpltool --merge newfile.mcpl file1.mcpl file2.mcpl file3.mcpl file4.mcpl
```

Note that files are considered compatible if and only if they have similar
settings and meta-data such as comments and binary blobs. Thus, the resulting
file will have the same such settings and meta-data as the originals.

### Merging incompatible files ("forcemerge")

Occasionally, the compatiblity requirements for the --merge option can not be
satisfied. At the expense of discarding descriptive meta-data such as comments and binary
blobs, a brute-force merge of the files can be instead performed with the
`--forcemerge` flag:

```shell
mcpltool --forcemerge newfile.mcpl file1.mcpl file2.mcpl file3.mcpl file4.mcpl
```

The settings and per-particle storage requirements of the resulting file will
automatically be adapted to be such that particles from all the input files can
be safely represented. For example, even if just one input file use
double-precision storage for its particles, the merged output file will use
double-precision for all of its particles.

Due to the loss of meta-data, the usage of the `--forcemerge` option should be
considered as a last-resort only and is in general not recommended.

### Get full usage instructions

Full usage instructions are obtainable with the `--help` flag:

```shell
$ mcpltool --help
```
```
Tool for inspecting or modifying Monte Carlo Particle List (.mcpl) files.

The default behaviour is to display the contents of the FILE in human readable
format (see Dump Options below for how to modify what is displayed).

This installation supports direct reading of gzipped files (.mcpl.gz).

Usage:
  mcpltool [dump-options] FILE
  mcpltool --merge [merge-options] FILE1 FILE2
  mcpltool --extract [extract-options] FILE1 FILE2
  mcpltool --repair FILE
  mcpltool --version
  mcpltool --help

Dump options:
  By default include the info in the FILE header plus the first ten contained
  particles. Modify with the following options:
  -j, --justhead  : Dump just header info and no particle info.
  -n, --nohead    : Dump just particle info and no header info.
  -lN             : Dump up to N particles from the file (default 10). You
                    can specify -l0 to disable this limit.
  -sN             : Skip past the first N particles in the file (default 0).
  -bKEY           : Dump binary blob stored under KEY to standard output.

Merge options:
  -m, --merge FILEOUT FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEN
                    Creates new FILEOUT with combined particle contents from
                    specified list of N existing and compatible files.
  -m, --merge --inplace FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEN
                    Appends the particle contents in FILE2 ... FILEN into
                    FILE1. Note that this action modifies FILE1!
  --forcemerge [--keepuserflags] FILEOUT FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEN
               Like --merge but works with incompatible files as well, at the
               heavy price of discarding most metadata like comments and blobs.
               Userflags will be discarded unless --keepuserflags is specified.

Extract options:
  -e, --extract FILE1 FILE2
                    Extracts particles from FILE1 into a new FILE2.
  -lN, -sN        : Select range of particles in FILE1 (as above).
  -pPDGCODE       : select particles of type given by PDGCODE.

Other options:
  -r, --repair FILE
                    Attempt to repair FILE which was not properly closed, by up-
                    dating the file header with the correct number of particles.
  -t, --text MCPLFILE OUTFILE
                    Read particle contents of MCPLFILE and write into OUTFILE
                    using a simple ASCII-based format.
  -v, --version   : Display version of MCPL installation.
  -h, --help      : Display this usage information (ignores all other options).
```

Running instead `pymcpltool --help` shows identical options as for the
`mcpltool`, with the exception that the merge, extract and repair options are
absent and that instead options to extract statistics are available:

```
Stat options:
  --stats FILE    : Print statistics summary of particle state data from FILE.
  --stats --pdf FILE
                  : Produce PDF file mcpl.pdf with histograms of particle state
                    data from FILE.
  --stats --gui FILE
                  : Like --pdf, but opens interactive histogram views directly.
```

### Extract statistics from a file

Using the `pymcpltool` with the `--stats` flag, it is possible to analyse a file
to get statistics of the contained particles and the distribution of their state
parameters:

```shell
pymcpltool --stats example.mcpl
```
```

```

Or, one can view the parameter distributions graphically by adding `--gui`:
```shell
pymcpltool --stats --gui example.mcpl
```
Resulting in plots of the file contents like these:

[![pdgcode distribution](LOCAL:images/pymcpltool_stats_gui_pdgcode.png){:height="100px"}](LOCAL:images/pymcpltool_stats_gui_pdgcode.png)
[![x distribution](LOCAL:images/pymcpltool_stats_gui_x.png){:height="100px"}](LOCAL:images/pymcpltool_stats_gui_x.png)
[![uz distribution](LOCAL:images/pymcpltool_stats_gui_uz.png){:height="100px"}](LOCAL:images/pymcpltool_stats_gui_uz.png)

Or one can produce a PDF file like [this one](LOCAL:pymcpltool_stats.pdf)
containing the plots by adding instead the `--pdf` flag:

```shell
pymcpltool --stats --pdf example.mcpl
```

### Extract file contents to text file

Using the `mcpltool` or `pymcpltool` with the `--text` flag (available since
MCPL version 1.2.0), it is possible to extract particle data from MCPL files
into simple text (ASCII) files. This might be useful for compatibility with
software expecting data in column-based text files, but the resulting files are
obviously significantly larger and less efficient to use than the original MCPL
files:

```shell
mcpltool --text example.mcpl out.txt
```
