FILES               : This file.
examples/           : Small standalone examples for reading and writing MCPL
                      files, either from standalone C or python applications or
                      through Geant4 simulations in C++. Also contains a small
                      sample MCPL file.
CMakeLists.txt      : Configuration file for optionally building and installing
                      via CMake (cf. the INSTALL file for instructions).
cmake/              : More files needed to support the CMake configuration.
src/mcpl/           : Implementation of MCPL itself in C, along with the mcpltool
                      command line application. The file mcpl.h is the public
                      interface of MCPL and mcpl.c is the implementation.
src/python          : Implementation of MCPL in the pure python module mcpl.py,
                      along with the pymcpltool command line application.
src/geant4/         : MCPL hooks for Geant4 in C++, in the form of two classes
                      implementing respectively a G4VSensitiveDetector and a
                      G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction.
src/mcnpssw/        : MCPL hooks for MCNP in C, in the form of a few .h/.c file
                      pairs and two command line applications which can be used
                      to convert between the MCPL format and the SSW files used
                      by MCNP.
src/mcnpptrac/      : MCPL hooks for MCNP in C, in the form of a few .h/.c file
                      pairs and two command line applications which can be used
                      to convert between the MCPL format and the PTRAC files used
                      by MCNP.
src/phits/          : MCPL hooks for PHITS in C, in the form of a few .h/.c file
                      pairs and two command line applications which can be used
                      to convert between the MCPL format and the binary dump
                      files used by PHITS.
src/tripolistock/   : MCPL hooks for TRIPOLI-4 in C, in the form of a few .h/.c
                      file pairs and two command line applications which can be
                      used to convert between the MCPL format and the .stock
                      files used by TRIPOLI-4 (STORAGE).
src/ssv/            : MCPL hooks for ASCII-SSV in C, in the form of a few .h/.c
                      file pairs and two command line applications which can be
                      used to convert between the MCPL format and an ASCII
                      Space Separated Values format.
src/mcstas/         : No actual code is here, just a small reminder of how the
                      MCPL plugin shipped with McStas can be used.
src/mcxtrace/       : No actual code is here, just a small reminder of how the
                      MCPL plugin shipped with McXtrace can be used.
src_fat/            : Various "fat" versions of files from the above directories
                      under src/, for convenience. These files are automatically
                      generated and also contain code under the zlib license
                      (see src_fat/LICENSE.zlib).
src_fat/LICENSE.zlib: License conditions for zlib (http://zlib.net) code, which
                      is embedded in files under the src_fat/ directory.
src_fat/mcpl.c      : Replacement for src/mcpl/mcpl.c which includes zlib
                      sources internally (thus making transparent compression
                      available even when zlib is not available to the build
                      system).
src_fat/*_app.c :     Single-file versions of the command-line applications
                      mcpltool, mcpl2ssw, ssw2mcpl, mcpl2phits and phits2mcpl.
                      These can be compiled without the need for any external
                      headers or libraries (except math-lib: -lm), and includes
                      both MCPL, zlib, mcnpssw, and phits sources internally as
                      needed.
src_fat/pymcpltool  : The pymcpltool in a single executable file is included
                      for consistency and convenience, although its contents are
                      similar to those of src/python/mcpl.py.
src_fat/Makefile    : Simple makefile for building the "fat" command-line
                      applications (cf. the INSTALL file for instructions).
