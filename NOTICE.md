and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). This work was supported in part
by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under
grant agreement No 676548 (the BrightnESS project).

Historical note
---------------

Before release 2.0.0 of the code, MCPL was released under the CC0 license from
Creative Commons. However, in recent years that license has fallen increasingly
out of favour in the open source community, and it was therefore decided to
instead adopt the more widely accepted Apache 2.0 license starting with the
release 2.0.0 (all MCPL developers naturally agreed to this relicensing at the
time).
