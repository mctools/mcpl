Historical note
---------------

Before release 2.0.0 of the code, MCPL was released under the CC0 license from
Creative Commons. However, in recent years that license has fallen increasingly
out of favour in the open source community, and it was therefore decided to
instead adopt the more widely accepted Apache 2.0 license starting with the
release 2.0.0 (all MCPL developers naturally agreed to this relicensing at the
time).
