The PHITS–MCPL interface has been tested with [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/) v3.10 and exploits the
existing PHITS capability to stop and subsequently restart simulations via
intermediate binary files, the so-called PHITS dump files. Available since MCPL
release v1.3.0, the PHITS-MCPL interface is thus implemented as two standalone
commandline converters: `phits2mcpl` and `mcpl2phits`.

A detailed description of PHITS dump files can be found in [the PHITS
manual](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/manual/manualE-phits.pdf), but as the dump
files must be configured to include the relevant information, the necessary PHITS input
deck configuration will be discussed below. Afterwards, a few typical usage
examples of  `phits2mcpl` and `mcpl2phits` will be provided.

Note that the `phits2mcpl` and `mcpl2phits` are provided as part of the `mcpl-extra` package, so if the commands are missing you should double-check that you have [installed the mcpl-extra package](LOCAL:get/) as well as `mcpl` itself.

## Configuration for PHITS input deck

# Producing binary dump files with PHITS

Binary dump files can be produced by PHITS in either of the so-called `t-cross`,
`t-product` or `t-time` tallies. In all cases, lines like the following must be
added in the relevant tally section:

```
   dump = 13
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16
   file = myout
```

Which will result in the binary dump files being produced with the name
`myout_dmp` alongside a dump summary text file named `myout`. The configuration
with 13 parameters given above includes polarisation (spin-direction)
information. The other supported variant forgoes polarisation information
and thus saves 22% on the resulting file size:

```
   dump = 10
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
   file = myout
```

The `phits2mcpl` command can accept binary dump files in either of the two
formats above, and is able to distinguish between them automatically. It is not
possible to use any other dump format than those two thus presented.

An example which includes the lines in a t-cross tally, capturing all particles
going from region 1 to region 2 in a particular PHITS setup, is:

```
[ t-cross ]
   part = all
   mesh = reg
   reg = 1
   r-from r-to area
    1      2   1.0
   dump = 13
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16
   file = myout
```

If one wishes to be more selective about the particle types captured, one can
change the `part` parameter, for example to: `part = proton neutron photon`.

Refer to the PHITS manual (linked above) for more details.


# Reading binary dump files into PHITS

Simply specify the binary dump file in the `[ Source ]` section of the
file. Note that the dump configuration must be listed exactly as below in order
to consume the dump files produced by default when using `mcpl2phits`:

```
[ Source ]
   s-type =  17
    file = phits.dmp
    dump = 13
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16
```

If files without polarisation info are produced by `mcpl2phits --nopol`, then
the format changes slightly:

```
[ Source ]
   s-type =  17
    file = phits.dmp
    dump = 10
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

Refer to the PHITS manual (linked above) for more details.


## Examples

A few examples and instructions of how to use `phits2mcpl` and `mcpl2phits` are provided in the following.

### Converting an PHITS file to MCPL

Simply providing the `phits2mcpl` command with the name of an existing PHITS file and the desired name of the MCPL file to be created, is enough to trigger the conversion:

```shell
phits2mcpl phits.dmp newfile.mcpl
```

Which produces an MCPL file (which has been automatically compressed to
`newfile.mcpl.gz`). However, it is possible to add more than the minimal amount of
information into the output file. First of all, the `-d` flag can be used to
enable double-precision rather than single-precision storage of floating point
numbers. Next, specifying `-c <path_to_input_deck>` will cause the PHITS input
deck used to generate the PHITS file in question to be embedded into the MCPL
header (can later be retrieved with `mcpltool -bphits_input_deck
newfile.mcpl`). Finally, the PHITS dump summary text file which is created
alongside the binary dump file can be likewise embedded, this time using the
`-s` flag. It is retrievable via `mcpltool -bphits_dump_summary_file
newfile.mcpl`.  It is highly recommended to embed these two files (input_deck
with `-c` and dump summary with `-s`) for later reference. Thus, enabling as
much information as possible in the MCPL file would happen with:

```shell
phits2mcpl -d -c input_deck -s dump_summary phits.dmp newfile.mcpl
```
Inspecting the resulting `newfile.mcpl.gz` with `mcpltool` might give an output like this (admittedly the PHITS file was not from a very interesting simulation):

```shell
mcpltool newfile.mcpl.gz
```
```
Opened MCPL file newfile.mcpl.gz:

  Basic info
    Format             : MCPL-3
    No. of particles   : 594
    Header storage     : 6434 bytes

### Converting an MCPL file to PHITS

Usage of the `mcpl2phits` command to convert an MCPL file into the PHITS format
is even simpler - simply supply the name of the input and output files:
```shell
mcpl2phits newfile.mcpl.gz phits.dmp
```
```
Opened MCPL file produced with "PHITS" (contains 594 particles)
Creating (or overwriting) output PHITS file.
Initiating particle conversion loop.
Ending particle conversion loop.
Created phits.dmp with 594 particles.
```
This will likely be all that is needed, but advanced users can of course find a
few more options for fine-tuning via `mcpl2phits --help`.

### Get full usage instructions

Full usage instructions are obtainable with the `--help` flag:

```shell
phits2mcpl --help
```
```
Usage:

  phits2mcpl [options] dumpfile [output.mcpl]

Converts the Monte Carlo particles in the input dump file (binary PHITS dump
file format in suitable configuration) to MCPL format and stores in the
designated output file (defaults to "output.mcpl").

Options:

  -h, --help   : Show this usage information.
  -d, --double : Enable double-precision storage of floating point values.
  -n, --nogzip : Do not attempt to gzip output file.
  -c FILE      : Embed entire configuration FILE (the input deck)
                 used to produce dumpfile in the MCPL header.
  -s FILE      : Embed into the MCPL header the dump summary text file,
                 which was produced along with the dumpfile itself.
```
and

```shell
mcpl2phits --help
```
```
Usage:

  mcpl2phits [options] <input.mcpl> [phits.dmp]

Converts the Monte Carlo particles in the input MCPL file to binary PHITS
dump file format and stores the result in the designated output file
(defaults to "phitsdata_dmp"). The file can be read in PHITS using
a configuration of (assuming the filename is "phits.dmp"):
     dump = 13
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16
     file = phits.dmp

Options:

  -h, --help   : Show this usage information.
  -n, --nopol  : Do not write polarisation info (saving ~22% in file size). The
                 PHITS configuration reading the file must then be (assuming the
                 filename is "phits.dmp"):
                                            dump = 10
                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
                                            file = phits.dmp
  -f           : Write Fortran records with 64 bit integer markers. Note that
                 the default (32 bit) is almost always the correct choice.
  -l<LIMIT>    : Limit the number of particles transferred to the PHITS file
                 (defaults to 0, meaning no limit).
```
