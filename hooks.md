In addition to using [generic tools](LOCAL:usage_cmdline/) to access and manipulate MCPL files, it is the intention that most users should be able to use MCPL as a means for file-based i/o of their simulation application, simply by utilising existing plugins and converters ("hooks") written by experts of those applications (possibly in collaboration with MCPL experts).

While more details about some such plugins and converters can be found in {% include linkpaper.html section=3
%}, brief documentation of some hooks can also be found on pages of this website. Use the navigation bar above or one of the following links to learn more about hooks for particular applications:

* [MCPL hooks for Geant4](LOCAL:hooks_geant4/)
* [MCPL hooks for McStas](LOCAL:hooks_mcstas/)
* [MCPL hooks for McXtrace](LOCAL:hooks_mcxtrace/)
* [MCPL hooks for MCNP](LOCAL:hooks_mcnp/)
* [MCPL hooks for PHITS](LOCAL:hooks_phits/)
* [MCPL hooks for other applications](LOCAL:hooks_others/)

Please [get in touch](LOCAL:contact/) if you are interested in helping out with providing hooks for applications not listed above, or to provide feedback on the existing hooks.
