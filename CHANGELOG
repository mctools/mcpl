v1.1.0 2017-03-29
      * Introduced new and more precise unit vector packing scheme. Consequently,
        MCPL_FORMATVERSION was increased from 2 to 3. Files in the old format
        remain fully functional.
      * Merging: Add mcpl_merge_files function which merges any number of
        existing files into a new one and rename mcpl_merge to
        mcpl_merge_inplace (the old obsolete form still works for now, but prints
        a warning when used). The mcpltool --merge interface is updated
        correspondingly. Gzipped files can now be merged directly. Warn users if
        merging a file with itself and error for safety if output of extractions
        or merges already exists.
      * MCNP SSW support: Format decoding now relies purely on layout of fortran
        records, allowing more files to be read, even from some custom
        compilations of MCNP. Also replaced a static read buffer with a dynamic
        one, fixing errors experienced by some users and support MCNP5 for the
        first time. File load printouts are improved slightly and all warnings
        about untested code paths now include a request for feedback.
      * ssw2mcpl: Embed more useful meta-data in MCPL header.
      * mcpl2ssw: Reference SSW file can now be gzipped.
      * Add option for universal weights in MCPL files, to save 4 or 8 bytes
        per particle in output from unweighted simulations.
      * Add MCPL_VERSION_STR macro to mcpl.h for convenience.
      * Bugfix: mcpl_particle_t userflags field changed from int32_t to uint32_t.
      * Obsolete *_rc versions of gzipping functions (old obsolete forms still
        work for now, but print warnings when used).
      * Fix spelling of mcpl_hdr_universel_pdgcode (old obsolete form still
        works for now, but prints a warning when used).
      * G4MCPLWriter: Fix capitalisation of StorePreStep/StorePostStep.
      * Build system and documentation: Add INSTALL file with more details
        concerning build and integration, and add a simple makefile for "fat"
        tools. Also add src_fat/LICENSE.zlib with the zlib license and reference
        it where relevant, and include the full text of the zlib license towards
        the top of all autogenerated "fat" files. Smaller updates to README and
        related files.
      * Simplify internal MCPL particle I/O by using buffer.
      * Fix rare issue where mcpltool --extract could distort unit vectors.
      * Guard against overflow in particle position during file navigation
      * Add a few more platform compatibility checks.
      * Fix flag name in CMakeLists.txt affecting zlib support in SSW converters.
      * Workaround incomplete C99 support in version 12 of intels C compiler.
      * Add small sample MCPL file (example/example.mcpl) to release.

v1.0.0 2016-09-07
      * Identical to 0.99.1.

v0.99.1 2016-09-04
      * Release candidate for MCPL 1.0.0
      * Add --extract flag for the mcpltool.

v0.7.0 2016-08-25
      * First github based public release of MCPL.
