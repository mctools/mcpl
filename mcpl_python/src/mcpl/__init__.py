"""Python module for accessing MCPL files.

The MCPL (Monte Carlo Particle Lists) format is thoroughly documented on the
project homepage, from where it is also possible to download the entire MCPL
distribution:

     https://mctools.github.io/mcpl/

Specifically, more documentation about how to use the present python module to
access MCPL files can be found at:

     https://mctools.github.io/mcpl/usage_python/
