If desired, it is possible to access the content of MCPL files from Python code
by using the `mcpl.py` Python module described on this page, available since MCPL
release 1.2.0. Notice that most end-users should not normally have to write code in
order to use MCPL. Rather, they should be able to use pre-existing converters or
plugins for their Monte Carlo applications (c.f. [hooks](LOCAL:hooks/)).

## Using the MCPL Python module

### Opening MCPL files and accessing particle contents

The simplest usage, opening an MCPL file and accessing the particle contents in
order, is straightforward:

```python
import mcpl
myfile = mcpl.MCPLFile("myfile.mcpl")
for p in myfile.particles:
   print( p.x, p.y, p.z, p.ekin )
```

Here we access and print out the particle positions (units of cm) and kinetic
energies (units of MeV). The field names and units are the same as in the
[C/C++](LOCAL:usage_c/) interface, and are documented directly via the
integrated help system of Python.  Thus, one can get a full list of all
available data fields by adding a `help(mcpl.MCPLFile)` statement anywhere.

### Access blocks of particles for efficiency

For large files, it can be much more efficient to load a large number of
particles at once, using instead the `particle_blocks` interface:

```python
import mcpl
myfile = mcpl.MCPLFile("myfile.mcpl")
for p in myfile.particle_blocks:
   print( p.x, p.y, p.z, p.ekin )
```

The code looks similar to the non-block case above, but fields like `p.x` or
`p.ekin` are now actually [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays rather than
single numbers. By default each block encompasses 10000 particles, a number
which can be tuned by adding a `blocklength` parameter when instantiating a new
`MCPLFile` object. Of course, unless the number of particles in the file is a
multiple of `blocklength`, the last block in the file will have fewer particles
(and shorter arrays).

### Access file-level meta-data

In addition to particle contents, it is of course also possible to access
file-level meta-data, as can be seen in this example:

```python
import mcpl
myfile = mcpl.MCPLFile("myfile.mcpl")
print( 'Number of particles in file: %i' % myfile.nparticles )
print( 'File created by: "%s"' % myfile.sourcename )
if myfile.opt_polarisation:
    print( 'File contains polarisation information' )
for c in myfile.comments:
    print( 'File has comment: "%s"' % c )
```

For a full list of all available meta-data fields, one can access the integrated
documentation by adding a line with `help(mcpl.MCPLFile)`.

## Where to find more documentation

Python support for MCPL was added after the release of the {% include
linkpaper.html %}, so currently the most comprehensive documentation for the API
provided by the `mcpl.py` Python module is to be found using Python's integrated
`help()` functionality, for instance by running one of the following commands in
a terminal:

```shell
python -c "import mcpl;help(mcpl.MCPLFile)"     # get documentation of MCPLFile class
python -c "import mcpl;help(mcpl.MCPLParticle)" # get documentation of MCPLParticle class
python -c "import mcpl;help(mcpl)"              # get all documentation
```

## How to install the MCPL Python module

The `mcpl.py` file is a pure Python module implemented in a single file, which
in addition to Python itself (both Python 2 and 3 are supported) only needs the
ubiquitous [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) module to be available on the
system. Thus, all that is required before MCPL files can be accessed from Python
is that the `mcpl.py` file is available somewhere on your system, in a location
where Python will find it. Running the command `python -c "import mcpl;print
mcpl.__file__"` can be used to debug that the module is available and in which
file it is found.

### Just download a single file and use it...

Naturally, one can simply use the following link to download and save the file:
{% include linkfile.html file="src/python/mcpl.py" download=true %}, and place
it anywhere in the PYTHONPATH, such as the directory from which you plan to run
your Python scripts.

### ... install it via pip

The MCPL Python module and pymcpltool was added to [Python Package
Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mcpl), and therefore it (and the
[pymcpltool](LOCAL:usage_cmdline#extract-statistics-from-a-file) commandline utility) can be installed via `pip`. Typically the
command to invoke to install MCPL via pip is therefore something as simple as:

```shell
python -mpip install mcpl
```

Of course, tweaks might apply: For instance one will typically either run the
command under `sudo` or by adding the `--user` flag in order to carry out
single-user installations. Furthermore, it might be necessary to replace the
word `python` in the command with either `python2` or `python3`, if a specific
Python version must be targetted.

### ... or use it as part of the MCPL distribution

The `mcpl.py` file is part of the MCPL distribution starting with release
1.2.0, and can after installation be used by adding the python subdirectory of
the installation to your Python path. For example, if you installed the MCPL
distribution in `/path/to/mcplinstall`, the following line will make the `mcpl.py`
module available from your Python code (put it somewhere like your `.bashrc` to
make the setting permanent):

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/mcplinstall/python:$PYTHONPATH
```
