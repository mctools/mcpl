The MCNP–MCPL interface currently supports MCNPX, MCNP5 and MCNP6 and exploits the existing MCNP capability to stop and subsequently restart simulations at a user-defined set of surfaces through the Surface Source
Write/Read (SSW/SSR) functionality, based on intermediate files. We refer to such files as "SSW files", although different names are occasionally used (e.g. "RSSA files"). The MCNP-MCPL interface is thus implemented as two standalone commandline converters: `ssw2mcpl` and `mcpl2ssw`. A detailed description of the commands, as well as references to the relevant MCNP manuals in which it is described how to enable the SSW functionality in a given MCNP _input deck_, is given in {% include linkpaper.html subsection=3.2 %} and the present page will merely provide a few typical usage examples.

Note that the `ssw2mcpl` and `mcpl2ssw` are provided as part of the `mcpl-extra` package, so if the commands are missing you should double-check that you have [installed the mcpl-extra package](LOCAL:get/) as well as `mcpl` itself.


At the bottom of the page is also included a quick and dirty recipe for how the `ssw2mcpl` and `mcpl2ssw` commands can be obtained without first downloading and installing the MCPL distribution. Note that users of the ESS dgcode framework already have access to the commands, and it is planned to provide McStas and McXtrace users with them as well
(cf. [this issue]({{ "/20" | prepend: site.github.issues_url }})).

## Examples

A few examples and instructions of how to use `ssw2mcpl` and `mcpl2ssw` are provided in the following.

### Converting an SSW file to MCPL

Simply providing the `ssw2mcpl` command with the name of an existing SSW file and the desired name of the MCPL file to be created, is enough to trigger the conversion:

```shell
ssw2mcpl sswfile.w newfile.mcpl
```
```
ssw_open_file: Opened file "sswfile.w":
ssw_open_file:    File layout detected : MCNPX
ssw_open_file:    Code ID fields : "mcnpx" / "2.7.0"
ssw_open_file:    Title field : "Example to write mcpl from mcnp5,mcnp6 and mcnpx"
ssw_open_file:    Source statistics (histories):        1000
ssw_open_file:    Particles in file            :        2000
ssw_open_file:    Number of surfaces           :           2
ssw_open_file:    Histories at surfaces        :        1000
MCPL: Attempting to compress file newfile.mcpl with gzip
MCPL: Succesfully compressed file into newfile.mcpl.gz
Created newfile.mcpl.gz
```
However, it is possible to add more than the minimal amount of information into the output file. First of all, the `-d` flag can be used to enable double-precision rather than single-precision storage of floating point numbers. Next, the `-s` flag will cause the MCNP surface ID's to be embedded in the MCPL userflags fields, and finally specifying `-c <path_to_input_deck>` will cause the MCNP input deck used to generate the SSW file in question to be embedded into the MCPL header (can later be retrieved with `mcpltool -bmcnp_input_deck newfile.mcpl`). In particular, it is highly recommended to embed the input_deck with `-c` for later reference, and the `-s` might be essential if the file is intended to be converted back for usage in an MCNP simulation with compatible surface ID's. Thus, enabling as much information as possible in the MCPL file would happen with:

```shell
ssw2mcpl -d -s -c input_deck sswfile.w newfile.mcpl
```
Inspecting the resulting `newfile.mcpl` with `mcpltool` might give an output like this (admittedly the SSW file was not from a very interesting simulation):

```shell
mcpltool newfile.mcpl
```
```
Opened MCPL file newfile.mcpl.gz:

### Converting an MCPL file to SSW

Usage of the `mcpl2ssw` command to convert an MCPL file into the SSW format is slightly more involved than the reverse conversion: in addition to an input MCPL file, the user must also supply a reference
SSW file in a format suitable for the MCNP setup in which the
resulting SSW file is subsequently intended to be used as input. This added complexity is necessary since different MCNP flavours have different SSW format, but also because the SSW file actually contains details about the simulation geometry used in a particular setup. It doesn't matter how many particles are stored in the reference SSW file, it can in principle be very small. Additionally, `mcpl2ssw` needs to assign MCNP surface ID's to all particles. This can be set globally with the `-s` flag, or else `mcpl2ssw` will try to use the contents of the MCPL userflags field as the surface ID's.

Assuming `refsswfile.w` is an SSW file in a format compatible with the target setup, the MCPL file `myfile.mcpl.gz` can be converted into a compatible SSW file, newfile.w, with the following command:

```shell
mcpl2ssw myfile.mcpl.gz refsswfile.w newfile.w
```
```
Opened MCPL file produced with "MCNPX" (contains 2000 particles)
Opening reference SSW file:
ssw_open_file: Opened file "refsswfile.w":
ssw_open_file:    File layout detected : MCNP6
ssw_open_file:    Code ID fields : "mcnp" / "6"
ssw_open_file:    Title field : "Example to write mcpl from mcnp5,mcnp6 and mcnpx"
ssw_open_file:    Source statistics (histories):        1000
ssw_open_file:    Particles in file            :        2000
ssw_open_file:    Number of surfaces           :           2
ssw_open_file:    Histories at surfaces        :        1000
Creating (or overwriting) output SSW file.
Initiating particle conversion loop.
Ending particle conversion loop.
Created newfile.w with 2000 particles (nrss) and 2000 histories (np1).
```

Note that here `refsswfile.w` is associated with MCNP6 while `myfile.mcpl.gz` was created with `ssw2mcpl` from an MCNPX file, but of course MCPL files from non-MCNP simulations can be used as well - assuming the surface ID's can be specified globally or in the userflags field. The reason the above example worked was that `myfile.mcpl.gz` had been created from with the `-s` flag to `ssw2mcpl` (the user should of course make sure that the surface ID's in the two setups were compatible).

Here is another example, in which the MCPL file originates in a Geant4 simulation, and the surface ID is set globally to 4 (again, it is the users responsibility that this makes sense):

```shell
mcpl2ssw -s4 g4output.mcpl refsswfile.w newfile.w
```
```
Opened MCPL file produced with "G4MCPLWriter [G4MCPLWriter]" (contains 1006 particles)
Opening reference SSW file:
ssw_open_file: Opened file "refsswfile.w":
ssw_open_file:    File layout detected : MCNP6
ssw_open_file:    Code ID fields : "mcnp" / "6"
ssw_open_file:    Title field : "Example to write mcpl from mcnp5,mcnp6 and mcnpx"
ssw_open_file:    Source statistics (histories):        1000
ssw_open_file:    Particles in file            :        2000
ssw_open_file:    Number of surfaces           :           2
ssw_open_file:    Histories at surfaces        :        1000
Creating (or overwriting) output SSW file.
Initiating particle conversion loop.
Ending particle conversion loop.
Created newfile.w with 1006 particles (nrss) and 1006 histories (np1).

### Get full usage instructions

Full usage instructions are obtainable with the `--help` flag:

```shell
ssw2mcpl --help
```
```
Usage:

  ssw2mcpl [options] input.ssw [output.mcpl]

Converts the Monte Carlo particles in the input.ssw file (MCNP Surface
Source Write format) to MCPL format and stores in the designated output
file (defaults to "output.mcpl").

Options:

  -h, --help   : Show this usage information.
  -d, --double : Enable double-precision storage of floating point values.
  -s, --surf   : Store SSW surface IDs in the MCPL userflags.
  -n, --nogzip : Do not attempt to gzip output file.
  -c FILE      : Embed entire configuration FILE (the input deck)
                 used to produce input.ssw in the MCPL header.
```
and

```shell
mcpl2ssw --help
```
```
Usage:

  mcpl2ssw [options] <input.mcpl> <reference.ssw> [output.ssw]

Converts the Monte Carlo particles in the input MCPL file to SSW format
(MCNP Surface Source Write) and stores the result in the designated output
file (defaults to "output.ssw").

In order to do so and get the details of the SSW format correct, the user
must also provide a reference SSW file from the same approximate setup
(MCNP version, input deck...) where the new SSW file is to be used. The
reference SSW file can of course be very small, as only the file header is
important (the new file essentially gets a copy of the header found in the
reference file, except for certain fields related to number of particles
whose values are changed).

Finally, one must pay attention to the Surface ID assigned to the
particles in the resulting SSW file: Either the user specifies a global
one with -s<ID>, or it is assumed that the MCPL userflags field in the
input file is actually intended to become the Surface ID. Note that not
all MCPL files have userflag fields and that valid Surface IDs are
integers in the range 1-999999.

Options:

  -h, --help   : Show this usage information.
  -s<ID>       : All particles in the SSW file will get this surface ID.
  -l<LIMIT>    : Limit the number of particles transferred to the SSW file
                 (defaults to 2147483647, the maximal SSW capacity).
```
