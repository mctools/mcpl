The official and supported way in which to build all files in the MCPL
distribution is via CMake, however, depending on the use-case it might be more
appropriate to simply integrate MCPL directly into the build system of a given
simulation framework, or to use a quick compilation of one of the "fat" versions
of the command line tools: mcpltool, ssw2mcpl, mcpl2ssw, phits2mcpl, or
mcpl2phits. Finally, the python module (mcpl.py) and associated tool
(pymcpltool) can be used directly without any build step. The various options
are discussed below.



Building via CMake
------------------

The MCPL distribution requires CMake version 3.10.0 or later. If you do not have
CMake installed, or if your platform has an older version installed, you have to
visit http://cmake.org/ and acquire a recent version. CMake is a very powerful
cross-platform configuration and build tool and a complete discussion of it is
beyond the scope of the present instructions. Further in-depth instructions and
tutorials are available at http://cmake.org/ and elsewhere online. The following
is a quick recipe (using an in-source build for simplicity):

1. Since you are reading this INSTALL file, it is assumed you have already
   unpacked the MCPL source distribution somewhere. Assuming this is in a
   directory called /path/to/mcplsource, step into this directory with:

   cd /path/to/mcplsource

2. Now, configure with CMake (assuming you wish to install the result into a
   directory called /path/to/mcplinstall):

   cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/mcplinstall

   This will fail if your system is missing basic build tools, such as a C/C++
   capable compiler. In addition to generic CMake options, you can fine-tune
   what will be build by adding one or more of the following flags to the
   command:

   * -DBUILD_WITHZLIB=OFF  [whether to link with zlib, default is ON]
   * -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF  [whether to build examples, default is ON]
   * -DBUILD_FAT=ON        [whether to build "fat" binaries, default is OFF]
   * -DBUILD_WITHG4=OFF    [whether to build G4 hooks, default is ON]
   * -DBUILD_WITHSSW=OFF   [whether to build SSW hooks, default is ON]
   * -DBUILD_WITHPTRAC=OFF [whether to build PTRAC hooks, default is ON]
   * -DBUILD_WITHPHITS=OFF [whether to build PHITS hooks, default is ON]
   * -DBUILD_WITHSTOCK=OFF [whether to build STOCK hooks, default is ON]
   * -DINSTALL_PY=OFF      [whether to install python files, default is ON]
   * -DMODIFY_RPATH=OFF    [do not do any special rpath treatment for binaries]

3. Perform the build and install in one step with (assuming you are on a
   platform where CMake generates makefiles):

   make install

4. Now you can use the installed files from /path/to/mcplinstall. For instance,
   you can invoke the mcpltool with (showing usage instructions):

   /path/to/mcplinstall/bin/mcpltool --help

   The python mcpl tool can also be used directly, assuming your machine
   contains a python (both python2 and python3 are supported) installation with
   the NumPy (numpy.org) module available:

   /path/to/mcplinstall/bin/pymcpltool --help

   If you additionally wish be able to use the MCPL python module in custom
   python code via "import mcpl", you have to add the python subdirectory to
   your python path:

   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/mcplinstall/python:$PYTHONPATH



Building "fat" tools via simple Makefile
----------------------------------------

Assuming you are only interested in getting access to the commands mcpltool,
mcpl2ssw, ssw2mcpl, mcpl2phits, or phits2mcpl , and that you are on a standard
UNIX-like platform such as Linux or OS X, you can forego the CMake build
described above and simply invoke a simple Makefile

1. Since you are reading this INSTALL file, it is assumed you have already
   unpacked the MCPL source distribution somewhere. Assuming this is in a
   directory called /path/to/mcplsource, step into this directory with:

   cd /path/to/mcplsource

2. Invoke the build:

   make -f src_fat/Makefile

3. The resulting binaries are now in src_fat/mcpltool, src_fat/mcpl2ssw,
   src_fat/ssw2mcpl, src_fat/mcpl2phits, and src_fat/phits2mcpl. You can copy
   them somewhere else or use them where they are. For instance, you can
   immediately invoke the mcpltool with (showing usage instructions):

   ./src_fat/mcpltool --help



Building "fat" tools via quick and dirty one-liners
---------------------------------------------------

If for some reason neither the CMake build nor Makefile above works for you, you
can skip using a build tool altogether and simply invoke a direct compilation
command, in order to build one of the command line tools (using one of the "fat"
source files).

1. Since you are reading this INSTALL file, it is assumed you have already
   unpacked the MCPL source distribution somewhere. Assuming this is in a
   directory called /path/to/mcplsource, step into this directory with:

   cd /path/to/mcplsource

2. Assuming you wish to build the mcpltool (exchange "mcpltool" with "ssw2mcpl",
   "mcpl2ssw", "phits2mcpl", or "mcpl2phits" in the commands below to build a
   different utility), simply do:

   gcc -std=c99 src_fat/mcpltool_app_fat.c -lm -o mcpltool

   If you have a different compiler than gcc (such as "clang"), of course
   put that instead of "gcc" in the command above.

3. You can copy the resulting binary somewhere else or use it where it is.
   For instance, you can immediately invoke the mcpltool with (showing usage
   instructions):

   ./mcpltool --help




Using just the MCPL python module or pymcpltool
-----------------------------------------------

If you just want access to the pymcpltool, you can run it directly from the
tarball via:

  ./src_fat/pymcpltool

Or you can copy it to a more "proper" location on your system and make sure it
is in your PATH. For example, if you are using the BASH shell, you could copy it
into a directory called $HOME/bin and put the following line in your .bashrc
file:

  export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

If you want access to the MCPL python module, and use it via "import mcpl" in
your python code, you must simply ensure that the file ./src/python/mcpl.py
resides somewhere in your PYTHONPATH. For example, if you are using the BASH
shell, you could copy it into a a directory called $HOME/python and put the
following line in your .bashrc file:

  export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH

Alternatively, depending on your python version and settings, it might simply be
enough to copy mcpl.py into your run directory.



Use MCPL from an existing environment
-------------------------------------

Presently (June 2019), MCPL is known to be integrated into McStas, McXtrace,
VITESS, RESTRAX/SIMRES and the coding framework of the ESS detector group. Users
of these environments will have already access to MCPL, as it is integrated and
distributed along with them. For the two former, refer to src/mcstas/README and
src/mcxtrace/README respectively for how to proceed (instructions for VITESS,
RESTRAX and SIMRES will be added at a later time).


Use MCPL from CMake-based projects
----------------------------------

Assuming MCPL was built and installed via CMake, it is since MCPL v1.4.0
possible for client projects to simply use MCPL as a CMake package in order to
correctly build their C/C++ code which depends on the inclusion of include mcpl.h.

Depending on where MCPL was installed on the system, it might be necessary to
let CMake know about it via the usual mechanisms (for instance passing
-DMCPL_DIR=/path/to/mcplinstall as an argument to cmake on the command line).

CMake code for a small project using MCPL might look like the following (assume
that exampleapp.c below includes the mcpl.h header:

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10...3.24)
  project(MyExampleProject LANGUAGES C)
  find_package(MCPL REQUIRED)
  add_executable(exampleapp "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/exampleapp.c")
  target_link_libraries( exampleapp MCPL::mcpl )
  install( TARGETS exampleapp DESTINATION bin )


Integrating MCPL into an existing environment
---------------------------------------------

Maintainers of a given development environment or simulation tool might wish to
integrate MCPL directly into their code-base, thus providing their users with
MCPL support and integration out of the box. How to best perform such
integration will naturally depend on the particular use-case, but a few general
pieces of advice are provided here (feel free to contact the MCPL team for
additional advice and feedback, see https://mctools.github.io/mcpl/contact/).

Note that as of MCPL CMake-based projects might wish to ignore the instructions
below and simply add a find_package(MCPL REQUIRED) statement to their CMake code
(possibly using the FetchContent CMake module). However, that comes with the
potential complication of putting an extra potential complication on your users,
so what is the correct solution most likely depend on the exact use-case.

1. If your users need code-level access to functionality provided in mcpl.h, you
   should copy src/mcpl/mcpl.h and src/mcpl/mcpl.c into a suitable location in your
   build system and make sure they are compiled into a library (like
   libmcpl.so). The compilation can proceed using either a C++ compiler (any
   standard), or a C compiler (using -std=c99 or later), and must be linked with
   the math library, due to internal usage of the sqrt function (typically
   supply -lm at the link stage). It is also highly recommended to enable
   zlib support by either setting -DMCPL_HASZLIB, as well as
   the include path for zlib.h and the appropriate link flag (typically
   -lz). Alternatively, zlib support can be enabled by substituting
   src/mcpl/mcpl.c with src_fat/mcpl_fat.c.
2. If you or your users need to use the MCPL python module in python code, copy
   over src/python/mcpl.py into a suitable location in your framework (should be
   in the PYTHONPATH).
3. Provide access to the mcpltool by compiling either src/mcpl/mcpltool_app.c or
   src_fat/mcpltool_app_fat.c (the former must be linked with the MCPL library
   compiled in item #1 above). Likewise, provide access to the pymcpltool by
   copying over either src/python/pymcpltool or src_fat/pymcpltool, depending on
   whether you also provide access to the mcpl.py module.
4. If your users use Geant4, you should copy over the two MCPL-G4 interface
   classes from src/geant4 and make sure the .cc files get compiled and linked
   with the MCPL library from item #1 above.
5. If your users use MCNP, or might interact with people who do, you should make
   sure to provide the mcpl2ssw and ssw2mcpl commands. This can either be done
   by simply copying over src_fat/ssw2mcpl_app_fat.c and
   src_fat/mcpl2ssw_app_fat.c and compiling them directly, or by copying over
   files from src/mcnpssw/, compiling sswmcpl.h, sswmcpl.c, sswread.h and
   sswread.c into a library (find instructions regarding flags at the top of the
   two .c files), and subsequently use that library when compiling
   mcpl2ssw_app.c and ssw2mcpl_app.c into the two command line applications.
6. If your users use PHITS, or might interact with people who do, you should
   make sure to provide the mcpl2phits and phits2mcpl commands. This can either
   be done by simply copying over src_fat/phits2mcpl_app_fat.c and
   src_fat/mcpl2phits_app_fat.c and compiling them directly, or by copying over
   files from src/phits/, compiling phitsmcpl.h, phitsmcpl.c, phitsread.h and
   phitsread.c into a library (find instructions regarding flags at the top of
   the two .c files), and subsequently use that library when compiling
   mcpl2phits_app.c and phits2mcpl_app.c into the two command line applications.
7. If applicable, provide your users with pre-written hooks using MCPL, in
   whatever form is suitable for your framework. For instance, the McStas
   developers added two user-visible McStas components: MCPL_input and
   MCPL_output. Internal code in these two components include and use functions
   from mcpl.h to implement their functionality (taking care of details such as
   user-visible parameters and multi-processing in the same way other McStas
   components do), but McStas users need not worry about those details. The
   integration is completed by making the mcpltool command available at the
   command line for McStas users.
